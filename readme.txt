A button whose text reads Hello, Console that, when clicked, will print Hello, World! to the console.
You'll need to figure out where the console is and how you open it!
A button whose text reads Hello, Pop-up that, when clicked, displays a pop-up window that say Hello, World!.
A button whose text reads Hello, Browser that, when clicked, generates the HTML necessary to render Hello, World! on the page.
The text should be rendered below the the button that was clicked.
A button whose text reads Hello, Stranger that, when clicked, does 2 things:
First, it should prompt the user to enter his or her name (hint: there's a built-in function called prompt).
Second, it should display a greeting to the user (i.e., using the name he or she entered).
This can be done in the console, as a pop-up, or in the browser.
